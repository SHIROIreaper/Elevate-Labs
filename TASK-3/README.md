# Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus

## Overview  
This document outlines the process of setting up **Nessus Essentials** and performing a vulnerability scan on a local machine. The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities and gain hands-on experience with a widely-used vulnerability scanning tool.

## Objective  
1. Install Nessus Essentials  
2. Set up scan target (local machine IP or `localhost`)  
3. Start a full vulnerability scan  
4. Wait for scan to complete (approx. 30â€“60 mins)  
5. Review the report for vulnerabilities and severity  
6. Research basic fixes or mitigations  
7. Document the most critical vulnerabilities  
8. Take screenshots of the scan results  

## Tools Used  

- **[Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)** â€“ A free vulnerability scanner by Tenable  
  > Refer to the [official installation documentation](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/InstallNessus.htm) for setup instructions.

## Results  

Nessus Essentials was successfully installed and a local scan was executed. Key learnings include:

- Initiating a full system vulnerability scan  
- Interpreting results by severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)  
- Understanding common misconfigurations and known CVEs  
- Exploring possible remediations or workarounds
