# Vulnerability Report

## Summary  
This document outlines key vulnerabilities discovered during a local Nessus vulnerability scan, with a focus on software version-related issues involving Node.js and Python Tornado. It also includes remediation steps taken and reflections on how such vulnerabilities arise and can be exploited.

---

## Findings  

### 1. **Node.js Version Vulnerability**  
**Description**:  
The scan identified an outdated version of Node.js that includes known vulnerabilities such as remote code execution, denial of service, or insecure dependencies.

**Risk**:  
- High risk due to remote code execution potential  
- Multiple CVEs linked to the detected version  

**Remediation**:  
- Updated Node.js to the latest LTS version using Node Version Manager (nvm):  
  ```bash
  nvm install --lts
  nvm use --lts
  ```  
- Rebuilt applications and restarted services to ensure compatibility

---

### 2. **Python Tornado Framework Vulnerability**  
**Description**:  
The Python Tornado web server was found to be an outdated version with known CVEs. Some of these included security issues such as header injection, insufficient request validation, and WebSocket handling flaws.

**Risk**:  
- Medium to High risk depending on how Tornado is integrated into applications  
- CVEs related to improper input sanitization and privilege escalation

**Remediation**:  
- Upgraded Tornado via pip:  
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade tornado
  ```  
- Validated functionality of dependent Python applications  
- Reviewed change logs to ensure no breaking changes affect the application logic

---

## Reflection: How These Vulnerabilities Can Arise  

These vulnerabilities typically exist due to:

- Developers not monitoring or updating dependencies regularly  
- Legacy systems that remain untouched due to "if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it" mindset  
- Automated CI/CD pipelines not including security checks or dependency audits  
- Lack of visibility into the software stack or security best practices

---

## Attack Vector Considerations  

Attackers often scan public or internal IP ranges for known ports used by Node.js or Tornado applications (e.g., 3000, 8000). Upon detecting vulnerable versions, they may:

- Exploit known CVEs to gain shell access or remote execution  
- Use vulnerability chaining if multiple issues exist  
- Perform fingerprinting to tailor payloads for specific versions

These findings reinforce the need for regular scanning, dependency management, and security-first software practices.

## Status:  Issues Mitigated  
All identified issues have been fixed and verified via a follow-up scan.
