## Objective

Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic.

## Tools Required

- **Linux Terminal** – Base operating system for executing commands.
- **Netcat (`nc`)** – For establishing and testing raw network connections.
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** – To manage firewall rules.
- **Wireshark – For traffic capture and analysis.
- **Any Android device with Termux**

## Result

- Established a communication channel between devices using port 23 (Telnet).
- Configured firewall rules to allow or block specific traffic.
- Verified that blocked traffic results in silent failure (no "connection denied" message), which is expected behavior for dropped packets.
- Gained hands-on experience with port-level access control and basic client-server interaction.
