# Network Traffic Capture

## Overview

This repository documents a practical walkthrough of network traffic capture and analysis using Wireshark. It serves as a foundational exercise in network visibility, protocol inspection, and packet-level troubleshooting.
---

## Objective

Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types

---

## Tools Required

The following tools and configurations were used throughout the project:
- [**Wireshark**:](https://github.com/SHIROIreaper/Elevate-Labs/blob/main/Day-1/Documentation/Wireshark.md) Packet capture and inspection.
- **Ping / Web Browser**: To generate traffic.

Full environment setup steps and command references are stored in [setup/setup.md](./setup/setup.md).

---

## Results
The packet capture has been completed and exported. Analysis focused on common protocols such as:
- **HTTP**
- **DNS**
- **TCP**
- **ICMP**

Key findings, filters used, and observed traffic patterns are documented in:
- [results/summary.md](./Result/summary.md)
- [results/wireshark-traffic.pcap](./Result/Files)

This directory also contains insights into protocol behaviors aligned with test activities.

**Note**: All directories contain raw data, analysis notes, or logs relevant to the corresponding step.
